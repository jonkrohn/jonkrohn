*Hello!* I'm [Jon Krohn](https://www.jonkrohn.com/), Chief Data Scientist at the machine learning company [Nebula](https://nebula.io/), and I share my passion for my vocation by creating:

* 📚 **Books**: My first, [Deep Learning Illustrated](https://www.deeplearningillustrated.com/), was an instant #1 bestseller that was translated into six languages. It is used for introductory courses on deep learning at universities around the globe. 
* 🎥 **Videos** — I present tutorials with accompanying open-source code, e.g., as part of my [machine learning courses](https://www.jonkrohn.com/courses). My [Udemy course](https://jonkrohn.com/udemy) has over 80,000 students and my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonKrohnLearns) was recognized with the 2021 Data Community Content Creator Award for the AI/ML category. 
* 🎙 **Podcasts** — I host the [SuperDataScience](https://www.superdatascience.com/podcast) show, a light-hearted program with well over 10,000 listeners per episode, making it one of the most popular data-science podcasts around.
* 🕺 **Lectures** — As cataloged on the [talks page of my website](https://www.jonkrohn.com/talks), I regularly teach classes online via O’Reilly as well as providing lectures in-person at world-leading universities, conferences, and companies.
